Interpassivity is a state of passivity in the presence of the potential of interactivity. The purpose of the concept is to "explain how works of art and media sometimes seem to provide for their own reception". The term was coined by Robert Pfaller and Slavoj Žižek, and combines the words "interactivity" and "passivity".
An example of interpassivity, given by Žižek, in his book "How To Read Lacan," uses the VCR to illustrate the concept. The VCR records a movie (presumably to be watched later). However, Žižek argues that since the VCR can record, people who own them watch less movies because they can record them and have them on hand. The VCR does the watching of the movie so the owner of the VCR can be free not to watch the movie. Žižek uses the VCR to demonstrate the big Other's role in interpassivity. The VCR, like canned laughter in a show, functions as a tool interacting with itself so the viewer can not watch the show.
Pfaller, a professor of philosophy at the university of Linz elaborated the theory of interpassivity within the fields of cultural studies and psychoanalysis. Juha Suoranta and Tere Vadén, working on the basis of Pfaller's and Zizek's insights, stress interpassivity's potential of changing "into its negative when illusory interactivity produces passivity".
