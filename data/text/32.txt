Garrett perceives the city like no one else I know. Seen through his eyes, it is newly porous, full of "vanishing points", "imperfect joinings" and portals – service hatches, padlocked doorways – that you wouldn't usually notice. The usual constraints on urban motion, whether enforced by physical barriers or legal convention, don't restrict him.
