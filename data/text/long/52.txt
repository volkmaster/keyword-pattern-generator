Coexistence has been defined in numerous ways: 1) To exist together (in time or place) and to exist in mutual tolerance. 2) To learn to recognize and live with difference. 3) To have a relationship between persons or groups in which none of the parties is trying to destroy the other. 4) To interact with a commitment to tolerance, mutual respect, and the agreement to settle conflicts without recourse to violence.
