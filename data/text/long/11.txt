On a first glance Kiosk 67 seems to be a child of its times, the futuristic 60s and the metabolist discourse as much as Stožice complex seems to be the product of the pre-crisis years of the early 2000s ... But a closer look could point to a converse deduction: that the Stožice complex is actually more reminiscent of the big collective projects of socialism that, if not executed exactly as planned and supported by a centralised authority tend to decay; while the Kiosk turned out to be the ultimately flexible typology, not only surviving despite it coming out of fashion, but even reaching a kind of resurgence in the recent years.
