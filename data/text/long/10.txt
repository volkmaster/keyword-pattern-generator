While discovering the vast emptiness of the ever temporary ruin of Stozice Center, we met the first of our specimen: A rather scuffed, formerly orange capsule-kiosk. Later we found another one, waiting patiently near the entrance of the parking lots. By that point, we were not so sure anymore, if it really was another one – or the same. Maybe, these modular capsules could join, dock, form some sort of weird metabolist wet dream and procreate. Maybe they multiply by night.
