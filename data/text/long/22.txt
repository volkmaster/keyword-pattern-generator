The Kiosk 67 is now relieving a kind of resurgence – from a popular and mass product of the 60s and 70s as well as through the oblivion phase of the 90s and 2000s it is now becoming reintegrated in the designers' and general society again, but not as the original product, more as a kind of 60's design fetish, a kind of collector's item that counters much of its more utopian (and perhaps also dystopian) original charge.
