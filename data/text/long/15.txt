We’ve found a dying object, specific to the city of Ljubljana, straight coming from the past. Able to have different functions. The Kiosk was able to be duplicated in strategics places in the city, with different programs, where people needed it. Also able to be renewed anytime, anywhere, moved or deleted. There’s no way to find the original technique to remake the most authentic kiosk today.
