As opposed to interactive arrangements, in which the work of art ‘outsources’ part of its own realization to the spectator, interpassive arrangements take up a part normally played by the spectator or consumer, namely the enjoyment or ‘consummation’ of the work of art. The spectator or consumer is made redundant; or rather, his or her involvement in the realization of the work has become superfluous. Apparently, the artwork aims to consummate itself, actively dis-interesting the spectator in its realization.
