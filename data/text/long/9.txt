Nobody except the guy I was talking with (he is the director of sales) was working on kiosks in the past. All other workers are too young. When the firm got restructured, all the files (moulds, testers, models, plans,...) got destroyed. The only thing left are personal savings of plans and drawings and he already gave this to MAO for the Mächtig exhibition.
