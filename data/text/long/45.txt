To inhabit a ruin or any kind of an existing place, a “space-as-it-is” as opposed to a “space-as-it-could-become”, means to discard the illusion of choice inherent in a conventional architectural work. Decision not to choose from future seemingly infinitive possibilities of a building provides the opportunity to inhabit the world as it is.
