Didier Faustino is an architect and artist working on the relationship between body and space. He started his own practice at the crossroads of art and architecture just after graduating in architecture in 1995. Since then he has been developing a multi-faceted approach, ranging from installation to experimentation, from visual art to the creation of multi-sensorial spaces, mobile architecture and buildings. Faustino’s work has been honoured with several prizes and shown in collective and solo exhibitions. He is frequently invited to lecture at major universities and institutions as well as international events. Didier Faustino currently divides his time between architecture (Spain, Mexico City, Portugal), art (with exhibitions in Grenoble, London and Rome) and teaching (AA School, Diploma Unit 2). He is also the new editor in chief of the French architecture and design magazine CREE.
